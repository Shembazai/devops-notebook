## About
Personal repo for Linux/DevOps experiments. Built on my homelab (Arch host, AlmaLinux VMs via KVM/QEMU). Tracks Bash/Python scripts, terminal deep-dives, and automations from my career pivot.

## Key Projects
- **Homelab Setup**: Migrated from bare Arch to Alma + KVM cluster. [See script](scripts/alma-migrate.sh) – Achieved 99% uptime with auto-backups.
- **Bash Automations**: Script for task scheduling (e.g., log rotation, VM snapshots). [Example](scripts/backup-qemu.sh) – Handles errors like a pro (inspired by trucker reliability!).
- **Local AI Deploy**: Python setup for Ollama/LLMs on Alma. [Guide](ai/local-llm.md) – Used AI-assisted coding for quick prototypes.
- **Terminal Mastery**: Notes from my course – aliases, tmux configs, etc. [Cheatsheet](notes/terminal.md)

## Tech Stack
- OS: Arch (host), AlmaLinux (enterprise sim)
- Virt: KVM/QEMU
- Lang: Bash, Python
- Tools: Ansible (next up), Git

## Why This Matters
Proves I can troubleshoot under pressure (15+ years in high-stakes ops) and automate the boring stuff. Fork/contribute if you're into FOSS!

## Connect
Montreal-based. RHCSA in progress. DM for collabs.
